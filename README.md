## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of the most expensive problems in business. Acquiring a new customer costs **5–25x more** than retaining an existing one. This project analyzes a telecom company's customer data to:

1. **Identify** which customers are most likely to churn
2. **Understand** the key drivers of churn
3. **Quantify** the revenue at risk
4. **Predict** churn probability for individual customers using ML

## 🎯 Key Findings

| # | Finding | Business Impact |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Month-to-month** customers churn at **~42%** vs 11% for annual contracts | Push customers to long-term contracts |
| 2 | **Fiber optic** internet users have the highest churn rate (~42%) | Improve fiber service quality |
| 3 | **Electronic check** payers churn more (~45%) | Incentivize auto-pay enrollment |
| 4 | **New customers** (< 6 months) are the highest-risk segment (~50% churn) | Invest in early onboarding programs |
| 5 | Monthly revenue at risk from churners: **~$139,000/month** | Targeted retention can save millions |

## 🤖 Model Performance

| Model | ROC-AUC | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|----|
| Logistic Regression | 0.84 | 0.67 | 0.79 | 0.72 |
| **Random Forest** | **0.87** | **0.72** | **0.81** | **0.76** |

**Top 5 Churn Predictors** (from Random Forest feature importance):
1. `tenure` — How long the customer has been with the company
2. `MonthlyCharges` — Higher charges → higher churn risk
3. `TotalCharges` — Correlated with tenure
4. `Contract_Two year` — Long contracts drastically reduce churn
5. `InternetService_Fiber optic` — Fiber users churn disproportionately

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

### Option 1 — One Command (Recommended)
```bash
python run_project.py
```
This installs dependencies, generates data, trains the model, and launches the dashboard.

### Option 2 — Step by Step
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Generate dataset
python data/generate_data.py

# 3. Run EDA
python notebooks/01_eda.py

# 4. Train ML model
python notebooks/02_modeling.py

# 5. Run SQL queries
python sql/run_queries.py

# 6. Launch dashboard
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```
